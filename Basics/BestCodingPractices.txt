Always call a method with parenthesis and not just method name like person1.talk,
it returns a bound method exception which means, the method has a self parameter and this bounds it to the object calling it or class in which it is being called
# when you try to print the above method call print(person1.talk()) it prints talk,none as the talk method prints talk and returns none which is printed

The class name always begins with a capital letter and is the proper naming convention of classes
According to PEP8, it is required to have 2 spaces before a class and after a class block
